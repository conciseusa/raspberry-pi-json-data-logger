Raspberry Pi Serial Port Cheatsheet
https://howtoraspberrypi.com/enable-port-serial-raspberry-pi/ - Starting point for this info

sudo raspi-config
Once raspi-config started, choose Interfacing options, then Serial.
Answer No to the part asking if you want to activate a shell via the serial connection,
then Yes to the part asking if you want to activate the hardware port.
Validate, do Finish, then say yes to the question asking if you want to reboot the Raspberry Pi.
If you want to use SSH or VNC, you can enable them also.

models 3 and later, use uart for serial not bluetooth
echo "dtoverlay=disable-bt" | sudo tee -a /boot/config.txt
sudo systemctl disable hciuart
sudo reboot

Test loop back with minicom. Connect a 1K resistor from TXD / RXD, can use a wire, but can cause damage if wrong pins connected.
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install minicom -y

sudo minicom -D /dev/serial0 -b 9600
A Minicom terminal starts up, if you type a letter, it should appear on the screen!
Baud rate set to 9600 so the terminal can be used like the Serial Monitor function in the Arduino IDE.
Some Arduino models do not use the serial port at D0, D1 to connect to the IDE,
so a hardware monitor like this is needed to monitor the data at D0, D1.


To make minicom easy to run, create a file on the desktop:
cd Desktop/

Use nano editor:
nano minicom9600.sh
#!/bin/bash
sudo minicom -w -D /dev/serial0 -b 9600
Ctrl O Ctrl X
-or-
echo '#!/bin/bash' > minicom9600.sh
echo 'sudo minicom -w -D /dev/serial0 -b 9600' >> minicom9600.sh

chmod +x minicom9600.sh

Now there will be a file on the desktop to click and run in the terminal


Tested with Raspberry Pi OS with desktop and recommended software December 2nd 2020

If you don't like minicom, you can try screen
!! when running screen and this script, it will grab most of the data before the  script py !!
sudo apt-get install screen
screen /dev/ttyS0 9600
exit Ctrl-a k (release Ctrl-a before pressing k)
